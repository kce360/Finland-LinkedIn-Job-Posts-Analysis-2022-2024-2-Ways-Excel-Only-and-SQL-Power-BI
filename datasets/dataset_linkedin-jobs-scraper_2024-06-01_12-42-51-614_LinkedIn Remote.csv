We are well known in tech circles as the publisher of Ubuntu, the preferred OS for cloud computing, containers, software engineering and AI/ML data science. With almost every team remote by default, Canonical sets the pace on the 21st-century digital workplace. We're small for a platform vendor, but profitable. Our goal is to be the world's best, not biggest, global software company.

This is an opportunity for a person with outstanding leadership, organisation and intellect, to build our Organisational Development team that develops and harmonises our management practices. We are now 1,000+ colleagues across 70+ countries. We would like to create a new team to focus on organisational development - specifically to deepen our insights and effectiveness as a remote-first and globally distributed organisation.

The whole world had a taste of remote work in 2020-21, and it has become a source of fascination and debate in business circles. We want to be the best in the world at it. We deeply believe that our mission is best served by hiring people evenly across the globe who are themselves highly motivated by that mission. However, we know that being effective remotely requires discipline and good habits, and we would like to invest in the research needed to understand that, the training and policymaking which enable it, and the selection mechanisms that ensure consistency of behaviours. We'd like to understand what really makes a distributed, remote-first workplace work. We think we're pretty good at this, remote-first for almost 20 years, but we know there is a lot still to understand, and the frontier of possibility continues to move outward. We'd like to invest in research, analytics and tooling which raises the bar even further for remote collaboration, organisation and leadership. Most importantly though we'd like to invest in training and bi-directional communications to ensure that our management team are consistent in setting and maintaining expectations in every team, in every time zone.

So first and foremost this is a role for someone who *wants* to develop managers and leaders, who *wants* to set the pace for distributed company management, who has the drive and the energy and the leadership skills to make that happen across hundreds of teams, and who has ideas to bring to the table for experimentation and evolution.

You will lead one part of a wider People team, a cross-disciplinary group of organisational psychologists, engineers, statistics / analytics experts, talent science and employee relations specialists. We are recruiting globally, and believe we are bringing in outstanding new colleagues in a way that is fearlessly global. Naturally, they come from a wide range of backgrounds, norms and experiences, and our goal in setting up the Org Dev team is simply to lead the leaders to a position of consistent clarity on who we are, how we roll, and how that changes over time.

Location: This role can be held anywhere in the Europe, Middle East or African time zones.

What your day will look like


 * Develop and implement an inspiring and comprehensive talent development and culture strategy
 * Host our ongoing discussion about management practices, skills, habits and perspectives
 * Deliver an exceptional experience for aspiring and existing leaders who want to become trusted Canonical managers
 * Own the renewal and activation of values internally and externally
 * Create and implement leadership performance indicators and metrics
 * Design, develop, and run management curricula
 * Own our management skills matrix for performance management, talent assessment, succession planning, mentorship, virtual learning and career development.
 * Lead engagement survey focus groups and change initiatives
 * Set up a company learning framework for training
 * Build and manage a new team of organisational development specialists
 * Analyze data and leading trends to better understand career development
 * Own Canonical's personal development budget, currently US$ 2,000 per person
   
   

What we are looking for in you


 * An exceptional academic track record
 * Excellent writing and communication skills

Summary

Wikimedia envisions a world where the sum total of human knowledge is available to everyone.

The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit home of Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, and other free educational projects, serves as the hub of a global movement of hundreds of thousands of contributors collaborating to collect and share the sum of all human knowledge with the world.

As Wikimedia pursues a new global strategic direction, our Legal department is tasked with solving many legal questions, including some that no one has fully considered before. We are looking for a privacy-focused lawyer to join our in-house legal department as Privacy Fellow, specializing in Europe. The Privacy Fellow will provide research and drafting on a variety of topics, as well as gain experience in product counseling, data governance, and privacy-related public policy work. The Privacy Fellow will monitor current developments in Europe and around the world to help the legal department adapt to changing regulations and promote people's ability to participate in knowledge online. This position provides an immersive in-house experience with specific education and mentorship in the areas of internet regulation, data governance, and privacy law.

This position will report to the Wikimedia Foundation's Senior Legal Counsel.

The position will last until August 1, 2025.

Who Should Apply:

At Wikimedia, we serve the world. We believe that there is no way to meaningfully achieve our goal of reaching every single human unless our organization reflects the full breadth of the human experience. To that end, the Wikimedia Foundation recruits candidates from a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families. A diversity of lived experiences is reflective of those who create and use Wikimedia every day.

 * Work individually and in teams under the supervision of attorneys on Wikimedia Foundation's privacy team, on new and developing issues related to privacy.
 * Research and offer guidance to the Foundation on existing and developing data protection regimes in Europe, and around the world.
 * Assist the privacy team in its efforts to monitor global developments in privacy that may affect free knowledge.
 * Manage and administer several ongoing projects under the supervision of the Foundation legal team.
 * Work cross-departmentally with colleagues at the Wikimedia Foundation to resolve legal questions and provide counsel.
 * Availability for meetings during at least some Pacific Time business hours.
 * Occasional other legal projects as assigned.
   
   

Skills and Experience:


 * Graduate degree in law, public policy, or related fields and excellent academic credentials. (Equivalent experience will be considered.)
 * Ability to work in English.
 * Experience working across borders, on matters in non-U.S. jurisdictions, or for clients outside the U.S., particularly matters relating to European law.
 * Deep understanding of privacy and other internet law issues and their context in Europe.
 * Experience with large and comprehensive research projects, especially on legal topics.
 * Ability to adhere to deadlines, and complete work independently.
 * Excellent written and verbal communication skills and attention to detail.
 * Experience working with a remote team.
   
   

Please note, this role may call for travel, including internationally, and for travel or work on weekends if and when needed, due to conferences, legal needs, etc. This is not a requirement, and alternate arrangements may be made where appropriate.

Qualities that are important to us:


 * Appreciation for and alignment with Wikimedia's mission.
 * Strong interpersonal and collaboration skills and ability to work well on a team.
 * A desire to learn, stretch, and grow.
   
   

Additionally, we'd love it if you have:


 * Knowledge of French, Italian, and/or German as a working language.
 * License to practice law in the United States and/or a country/countries of Europe.
 * Training, knowledge, or experience with global data privacy law.
 * Experience working internationally, for international clients, or on international law.

Be among the first 25 applicants,234280,Canonical,https://uk.linkedin.com/company/canonical?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name,Full-time,"Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1000+ colleagues in 70+ countries and very few office based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.

We are hiring IoT Sales Representatives to expand our reach in mission-critical industries such as Automotive, Medical Devices, Industrial Systems, Robotics, and Telco, as well as consumer electronics. We are looking for candidates who are technically skilled and familiar with embedded Linux and RTOS. We are expanding in all time zones, so we can accommodate candidates from almost any country as long as they have reasonable business access to a substantial market territory in person. As we grow our teams we will also hire Sales Team Managers and Regional Sales Directors, please continue with this process if your goal is a management leadership position.

The server edition of Ubuntu is already very widely used in connected devices and industrial PC's. Our newer edition of Ubuntu for IoT, called Ubuntu Core, represents the state of the art in security and resilience for high end appliances and equipment. Our customers include global brands in consumer and industrial electronics as well as automotive and robotics. We continue to expand our range of offerings to bring our security, management and developer experience to the smallest Linux environments and devices. We recently added a real-time Linux capability and are working towards a range of certifications for these offerings. Together, this portfolio is Linux reinvented for optimal reliability, security, developer productivity and footprint.

This is a prospecting sales and strategic account development role and requires energy, ambition and focus. In order to be successful, you must be comfortable positioning and selling open source, services, and software solutions to all levels of an organization, and specifically to departments that are developing embedded software and IoT devices. You should also be familiar with at least one of our priority sectors.

Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application. Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.

We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.

In building our sales team, we look for five things:


 * Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems
 * High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence
 * Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes
 * Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions
 * Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers
   
   

Ubuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with brands in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.

The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.

Location: We are growing our sales reach in all regions - EMEA, APAC and Americas.

What your day will look like


 * Build and execute a territory plan to prioritise leading security-focused brands and manufacturers
 * Work with marketing to promote our brand and increase market awareness in prioritized accounts

 * Confidence to respectfully speak up, exchange feedback, and share ideas without hesitation
 * Track record of going above-and-beyond expectations to achieve outstanding results
 * Field sales experience in embedded Linux, embedded software, or enterprise software

We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.

We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.

In building our sales team, we look for five things:


 * Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems
 * High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence
 * Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes
 * Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions
 * Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers
   
   

Ubuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.

The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.

Location: We are expanding our sales organisation globally and have open roles in every region.

What your day will look like


 * Represent the company, its solutions and software, in your territory
 * Build and execute a territory plan to prioritize outreach and prospecting
 * Develop new pipeline through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry events
 * Close contracts to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets
 * Be mindful and proactive in achieving tactical and strategic objectives
 * Manage customer relationships and interactions through all stages of the sales cycle
 * Work with field engineers to propose solutions that solve our customers' business problems
 * Work with customer success to identify growth opportunities
 * Maintain accurate pipeline data and forecasts within Salesforce
 * Establish productive professional relationships with key influencers and decision makers
   
   

What we are looking for in you


 * Bachelor's level degree, preferably in engineering or computer science
 * Experience of open source technology and solutions
 * Detail oriented with effective follow-up
 * Experience in enterprise software or technology sales planning and execution
 * Track record of achievement in sales targets and new account wins
 * Self-discipline and motivation to be successful in a distributed team
 * Professional written and spoken English, as well as any language that may be appropriate for your target market
 * Ability to travel for customer engagements, industry events and company events
   
   

Additional Skills Of Interest


 * Specific vertical experience, in particular finance, telco, health, energy, public sector, tech
 * Experience speaking at conferences or industry events
   
   

What we offer you

We consider geographical location, experience, and performance when shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven commission structure. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.

 * Annual compensation review

Our collective sensemaking platform helps humans build multidimensional shared understanding and we analyze and find patterns in that for our members and clients.

You would represent what many would call a great developer, you know what it means to be senior developer. You are someone who is definitely wanting to make their mark in a startup, you care about what we are aiming to change in the world and you have the mindset to be consistent and persevere. Otherwise it would be just another job.

An immediately salaried 'job' is not what you are after but showcasing your experience in coding within a startup for the potential for massive return with success (shares first, later salary added once funded, we progress). We make it possible for you to take the first startup step in a part-time role as a working shareholder.

Technology and development environment

We're looking for a senior full-stack developer - someone who takes responsibility, authors high-quality sustainable code, and works well in a distributed agile environment.

The Hunome team seeks reinforcements in the development team to add to the expertise around full-stack development in Node.js, React, Typescript, PostgreSQL, and Neo4j. In particular BE interest and expertise would be great.

Our startup environment and plans for growth mean that there's lots of do and plenty of opportunity (including AI and machine learning) to make a difference, so you definitely won't be bored!

Working conditions


 * Commitment of 20hrs per week on average in exchange for ownership in Hunome (Hunomics Ltd). Anything less in hours, consider this carefully, and you will be in constant catch-up mode with others covering. Serious roadmap, serious team, serious progress is what we need to be looking for together.
 * You need to attend certain meetings, but otherwise, you can be flexible in how you arrange the work.
 * A distributed and diverse team with many nationalities in it.

 * We use English as a working language.
   
   

The deal


 * We have a team who can find their daily bread from different sources with ease, and their future potential with Hunome with the 20hrs per week.
 * Naturally, with the momentum we now build, we will seek funding, and as we secure that we will pay salaries.
 * Please note that if you are currently employed by a large IT-services firm your contract may exclude you from this deal.
 * This is part-time (20hrs) until we are funded, then full-time, with salary and holding onto the direct equity ownership in the company.
 * Not easy to combine this with a full time job already but not immediately closing you out either. Your success in this role depends on your startup ready mindset and stable life situation.
 * We do NOT want startup tourists, who are here one day and gone the next, joining for reasons that have nothing to do with wanting to build something successful and be a real contributor in that success.
 * We see that for example if you are in a part-time role elsewhere for salary and join Hunome for the other part-time role for ownership and longer term interests that works well.

Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.

Take onboarding, for example. With Rippling, you can hire a new employee anywhere in the world and set up their payroll, corporate card, computer, benefits, and even third-party apps like Slack and Microsoft 365—all within 90 seconds.

Based in San Francisco, CA, Rippling has raised $1.2B from the world’s top investors—including Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, and Bedrock—and was named one of America's best startup employers by Forbes.

What is an employer of record (EOR)?

An Employer of Record (EOR) is a service provider that allows companies to legally hire and work with employees in foreign countries without establishing their own legal entity in that country. This is made possible through a legal arrangement where the EOR establishes its own legal entity in the country and hires employees on behalf of the client company. This arrangement offers a viable solution for companies that wish to expand their global reach without investing in setting up a legal entity in every country where they operate.

About The Role

Rippling’s Employer of Record service gives companies the power to hire people across the globe without setting up a local entity. As a Senior HR Advisor, you will support Rippling in helping manage the entire employee lifecycle for these international hires: from initial onboarding to offboarding, and everything in between. This role will be responsible for managing all employee relations issues for our EOR clients, including but not limited to, dealing with claims, investigating complaints, leave and disability management, as well as answering our client’s HR questions. Additionally, you will be helping Rippling to set up and test the hiring, onboarding, transition, and termination workflows in our system.

Please note this is a part-time contract position (20-25 hours a week). You can expect the contract to last 3-4 months. The position is remote, and able to be based anywhere in Finland.

 * Respond to inquiries from clients, and develop programs and processes with our sales, implementation, support, and client services teams to meet our commitments to our customers
 * Establish processes to both professionalize our offering and optimize our efficiency around these offerings
   
   

What You Will Need


 * 6+ years of experience providing HR advice/consulting services to clients, or in an internal HR business function for a fast-paced organization in Finland
 * 6+ years of full payroll administration experience in Finland
 * Deep understanding of human resources and payroll compliance rules and regulations in Finland

Olet sitten hiljattain radiologiaan erikoistunut tai jo rutinoitunut erikoislääkäri, et jää missään vaiheessa yksin. Tämän varmistavat yli 4500 muuta lääkäriä kaikilta erikoisaloilta.

Radiologian erikoisalalla olemme viime vuosina keskittyneet erityisesti toimiviin ja ajantasaisiin it-järjestelmiin sekä kuvantamisen laatuun. Olemme panostaneet esimerkiksi tuki- ja tekoälyyn sekä tämän kehitystyön ansiosta saamme kuvista entistä tarkempia, parempia ja myös nopeammin käsittelyyn.

Meillä kuvantamisen tiimit ovat täynnä moniammatillista osaamista ja työtä tehdään tiiviisti osana porukkaa. Tiimissä työskentelee radiologien ohella röntgenhoitajia, jotka toteuttavat kuvat lujalla ammattitaidollaan. Kuvantamisessa on käytössä kaksoisluentajärjestelmä, jonka kautta lausunnot kulkeutuvat satunnaisesti lausuttavaksi uudelleen toiselle radiologille. Tämä antaa sinulle ainutlaatuisen mahdollisuuden nähdä kollegojen tapaa analysoida ja arvioida erilaisia tapauksia.

Kuten Radiologian Erikoisalajohtajamme Tomi Pudas Mainitsee

""Omasta työstä saa koko kuvantamisen kattavan kaksoisluennan ansiosta ikään kuin vertaisarvion ja monien paljon kaipaamaa palautetta, jonka kautta on osaajillemme löytynyt uudenlaisia mahdollisuuksia kehittää omaa osaamista. Välittäminen tarkoittaa paitsi toisistamme välittämistä, myös sitä, että välitämme oman työmme laadusta. Vaikkapa meillä kuvantamisessa välitämme siitä, että saamme oikean ja laadukkaan tuloksen. Ja jos jotakin kuvista löytyy, välitämme myös siitä, miten kerromme tuloksesta eteenpäin potilaalle. Teemme laadukasta työtä ja välitämme työstämme sekä potilaasta.""

Terveystalossa tulet osaksi vahvaa työyhteisöä, jossa ovat edustettuina kaikki lääketieteen erikoisalat – ainoana yksityisenä toimijana Suomessa. Olemme sitoutuneet työskentelemään sen eteen, että meillä työskentelevät nyt ja jatkossa toimialamme parhaat asiantuntijat ja osaajat.

Urologia toimii osana vatsan erikoisaloja, jolloin saat laajan kollegaverkoston, moniammatillisen työskentely-ympäristön ja nykyaikaisen tutkimusvälineistön. Yhteistyö mahdollistaa asiakkaan ohjaamisen oikealle ammattilaiselle oikeassa hoidon vaiheessa.

Meillä on 18 sairaalayksikköä ympäri Suomea, joissa voi erikoislääkärinä tehdä myös päiväkirurgisia urologisia leikkauksia. Viime vuosina olemme kehittäneet urologian tutkimus- ja hoitolaitteitamme. Esimerkiksi Kampissa on käytettävissä GreenLight-viherlaserlaitteisto eturauhasen liikakasvun hoitoon. Eturauhasen MRI-tutkimus on hiljan standardoitu ja niitä tehdään useissa toimipaikoissa sekä kiertävissä mobiilirekoissa noin 20 paikkakunnalla. Lausunnot on keskitetty eturauhasen diagnostiikkaan perehtyneille radiologeille. Kystoskooppi ja eturauhasen ultraäänilaite ovat käytettävissä keskisimmissä yksiköissä, joissa on myös mahdollisuus pientoimenpiteiden tekemiseen. Erikoistuvan urologin työ tulisi olemaan yleislääkärin vastaanottoa, mutta profiilin lisätiedoissa on maininta erikoistumisesta.

Urologialla hoidamme pääosin yksityis-, vakuutus- ja työterveysasiakkaita, mutta myös julkisen sektorin asiakkaita. Yhteistyö muiden erikoisalojen sekä hoitohenkilökunnan kanssa on sujuvaa. Käytettävissä oleva mobiili Terveystalo PRO-sovellus helpottaa oman työnsä suunnittelua ja ajankohtaisten tiedotteiden seuraamista. Urologian erikoisalajohtajana toimii Susanna Pasanen.

Terveystalossa tulet osaksi vahvaa työyhteisöä, jossa ovat edustettuina kaikki lääketieteen erikoisalat – ainoana yksityisenä toimijana Suomessa. Olemme sitoutuneet työskentelemään sen eteen, että meillä työskentelevät nyt ja jatkossa toimialamme parhaat asiantuntijat ja osaajat.

Haluaisitko mukaan tekemään työtä terveemmän elämän puolesta!
